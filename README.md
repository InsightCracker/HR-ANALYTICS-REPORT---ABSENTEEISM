![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-11-28 133001-1.png>)
### Executive Summary
This HR Absenteeism Analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of employee absence patterns using multiple behavioral, demographic, and operational indicators. The findings reveal that absenteeism is heavily influenced by health-related factors, commute challenges, age groups, and work tenure, with significant seasonal and monthly fluctuations.

### 🔍Key highlights:
- Total Absenteeism Hours: 5,100+ hours
- Total Absentees: 737
- Average Absence Hours per Employee: 6.95 hours
- Average Employee Age: 36.4 years
- Peak absenteeism occurs in February, March, and July.
- The 30–39 age group accounts for the highest number of absences.
- Medical consultations and musculoskeletal issues are the leading reasons for absence.
- Employees with longer service (11–19 years) contribute significantly more hours of absence.

### 📊Absenteeism Patterns Over Time
Monthly Trends - Absenteeism varies considerably across the year.
#### Highest Months:
- February
- March
- October
#### Lowest Months:
- January
- December

These patterns suggest:
- Early-year health issues (flu season)
- Mid-year fatigue or workload increases

Day-of-the-Week Trends
- Monday has the highest absenteeism.
- A gradual decline follows through Wednesday.
- Thursday dips significantly, suggesting midweek productivity.
- Absences rise slightly again on Friday.
#### This is a classic pattern associated with:
- Weekend recovery
- Low motivation at week start
- Early “weekend extension” effects on Fridays

Seasonal Trends
- Fall shows the highest absentee hours
- Spring and Summer show moderate activity
 -Winter is lowest

This suggests:
- Fall-related illnesses (allergies, viral infections)
- Weather transitions affecting commute or health

### 🧬Health & Lifestyle Impact
#### Leading Reasons for Absence
The top contributors to total absence hours are:
- Diseases of the musculoskeletal system
- Injury, poisoning, external causes
- Medical consultation
- Dental consultation
- Diseases of the digestive system

#### Insight: Most absences are health-related, highlighting the need for:
- Improved workplace ergonomics
- Medical support programs
- Safety interventions

#### BMI (Body Mass Index) Relationship
A scatter chart shows: 
- Higher absence hours among employees with overweight and normal BMI
- Lower among obese employees

#### Social Drinker & Smoker Impact
Pie charts show:
- Social drinkers represent a larger portion of absenteeism
- Social smokers contribute a smaller proportion, but missing work more consistently when they do

### 👥Demographic Factors
#### Age Group Influence
Absenteeism by age group:
- 30–39 years show the highest absenteeism
- Followed by 40–49 years
- Under 30 and 50+ contribute significantly less

Interpretation: The 30–39 range often aligns with higher family responsibilities, job pressure, or health transitions.

#### Education Level
Employees with Associate degrees show the largest share of absence hours while Higher education levels (Bachelor, Master, Doctoral) show significantly less absenteeism.

This may correlate with:
- Job types
- Flexibility
- Work environment conditions

#### Number of Children (Sons)
Absenteeism increases with:
- Two children
- Lowest among employees with three children

### 🚗 Work & Commute Factors
#### Commute Distance
Scatter plot reveals:
- Long commutes (50km+) show high absentee hours
- Moderate commutes (20–39km) show mixed behavior
- Shorter commutes (under 20km) also show spikes

This means distance alone isn’t the sole predictor, but long commutes significantly increase fatigue and lateness.

#### Transportation Expense
Bar chart insights:
- Absenteeism is highest among employees spending $150–$249 on transportation
- Sharp drop for $300+ spenders (these may be higher income or closer to the workplace)
- Commute cost is correlated with location and transport difficulty.

#### Length of Service
Service time vs absenteeism:
- 11–19 years of service show extremely high absence hours
- New hires (0–9 years) show moderate hours
- Employees with 20+ years show minimal hours (likely nearing retirement or more stable roles)

Possible interpretation:
- Mid-career burnout
- Tenure-based confidence (reduced fear of disciplinary action)

### 📌 Operational Risks Identified
- Health-related absences make up over 60% of total absence hours.
- Commute challenges strongly impact absenteeism.
- The 30–39 age group represents the highest risk segment.
- February, March, and October require proactive workforce planning.
- Employees with 11–19 years of service may be experiencing mid-career strain.

### 🟢 Recommendations
#### Health & Wellness Programs
- Introduce ergonomic assessments
- Provide subsidized physiotherapy or health screenings
- Track musculoskeletal complaints early

#### Commute Support
- Transport allowance adjustments
- Shuttle or carpool programs
- Hybrid work options for long-distance commuters

#### Engagement for Mid-Career Employees
- Job rotation programs
- Stress management workshops
- Recognition and incentive programs

#### Targeted HR Interventions
- Flag employees with recurring medical consultations
- Understand underlying causes of age-group differences
- Review workloads during high-absence months

### 🧾Conclusion
This analysis provides a detailed understanding of absenteeism drivers related to health, lifestyle, commute, demographics, service time, and seasonal factors. Using these insights, HR can implement strategic interventions to reduce absenteeism, improve workforce productivity, and enhance employee well-being.
